   Summary:

      1. wp-includes, wp-admin proves that this website is made up of wordpress.
      2. Cgi-bin directory is also exposed which contains all the cgi-scripts. This can lead to a potential shellshock attack. But while visiting it, with help of burpsuite, it turns out
         that it is giving a status code of 403(Forbidden). Same is for /mailman page and /wp-includes/ directory. 
      3. Some pages were redirecting to a different page containg some date and name in the path. Seems like they are some posts made on the date mentioned 
         in the URL. 
      4. wp-login.php page and a webmail can also be found.

   Screenshots:

    Summary:

       1. robots.txt file disallows any user-agent to visit /wp-admin/ directory. Trying to visit that directory will redirect the request to /wp-login.php
       2. However, robots.txt file allows visiting the page /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php. But, visiting this page only displays "0".
       3. Sitemap can also be seen in xml format. Admin is the only user who is responsible for wrting the posts.   
    
3. xmlrpc.php

   Summary:
      1. Since it is a wordpress website, there was a possibility for the xmlrpc.php file to be exposed. And it is exposed.  
      2. After checking the functionality of the XML-RPC server, it seems like the XML-RPC server is disabled. Following xml document was used to check the funtionality.
         <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> 
         <methodCall> 
         <methodName>system.listMethods</methodName> 
         <params></params> 
         </methodCall>
